Notes:

1) Changed header names in both budget and enrollment files.
2) Budget total for Maury is implausible (but line items OK). Changed budget total for Maury to reflect dcpsdatacenter value.
3) Code for Langley ES in budget does not match enrollment file. Changed enrollment code to match budget.
4) Code for Capitol Hill Montessori in budget does not match enrollment file. Changed enrollment code to match budget.
